<h2>Assignment 4</h2>

<h3> Overview </h3>

<p>As a sports fan, I wanted my Wack-a-Mole game to be sports-themed. Initially, I started out with a [non-US] football-themed game, and made all the ellipses into soccer balls. However, I wanted to replace the hammer with something that fits the specific game, and the only thing I could think of which  fits football is cleats. After looking through multiple graphics, I did not find a version that I felt made sense in the game (or was of the right angle). As a result, I switched to Basketball, since I felt like having a hand fits those better.<br><br> As for the bonus state, I made it a less frequent option where the balls are gold, and hitting them gains the player 30 extra points (rather than just 1). While the bonus state is hard-coded to be less frequent than both on and off states, when it actually shows up and in which location is randomized, making it harder to expect when it will show up - but also meaning the player may very well achieve it by pleasant coincidence.</p>
